# NLP-Analysis-Survey-Shiny
Super Bowl survey data analysis - NLP 

We are happy to present our survey insights visualized with Shiny, enabling YOU to explore insights interactively! The Topic is Super Bowl, and our business goal is to help the NFL find out how survey answers impact the participant's productivity the day after the event. These insights for instance can be used to target post event sales for identified fans. 
 
We asked our audience six questions about the Super Bowl and their behavior during the event, including a final question of how productive they were the following day.
